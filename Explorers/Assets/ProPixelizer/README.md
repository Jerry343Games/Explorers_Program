# ProPixelizer

ProPixelizer is a Unity package to render 3D objects in a pixelated, 2D sprite art style.

Redistribution of ProPixelizer is prohibited. If you obtained a copy by other means, please respect the efforts I made to develop and maintain ProPixelizer by purchasing a copy from the asset store:

A pdf of the User Guide is included in this directory. An up-to-date guide for the latest version can also be found at: https://sites.google.com/view/propixelizer/user-guide

## GitHub

I host a development version of the repo on GitHub, which you are welcome to use if you want to see upcoming features and fixes before they hit the store, or to see issue tracking. I usually add the asset as a submodule to my own projects.
