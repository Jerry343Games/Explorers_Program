//WHAT ARE ALL THE FOLDERS FOR//
////////////////////////////////

Hello! Thank you for downloading Pixelate. Here are a few pointers to help you navigate and make sense of this unity asset.

- In the root folder, you will find a DEMO folder. This folder contains a 3D model and 2 animations from Adobe Mixamo (these cannot be used in a commercial game)
it also contains two 2D animations created with Pixelate (an Idle and Running animation).

- In the scenes folders, you will find two scenes. The scene labeled "Capturing" is where you will create all your animations.
The "Visualize" scene is where you can see your new 2D animation in action (just switch out the sprite and the material)

///////////////////////////
//STEP BY STEP HOW TO USE//
///////////////////////////

PS: if you ever get stuck, join the discord server (https://discord.gg/ASkVNuet8K) and I will help you solve the problem :)

STEP ONE: Import your 3D model (works better with unlit colors instead of texture, if using texture I recommend reducing the max size of the texture)

STEP TWO: Import the 3D animations for your model (Don't worry about the framerate of the animation being to high we can change that later)

STEP THREE: Drag your character into the "Capturing" scene and delete the temporary character

STEP FOUR: Select the "PixelateCaptureManager" and assign the target as your model and assign the source clip as the animation you want to render

STEP FIVE: Customize the frames per second and the cell size to your liking (ps: drag around the current frame to see your animation in real-time)

STEP SIX: Click the button labelled "Capture" and select the download location (I recommend downloading straight into the project folder)

STEP SEVEN: Make sure you have the "2D Sprite" package downloaded from the Package Manager (You should have it if your project is a 2D project)

(IF ALL YOU WANT IS A SPRITE SHEET WITH NO REAL-TIME LIGHTING YOU ARE FINISHED)

STEP EIGHT: Create a material and select "Shader" at the top of the material properties, then search for "ToonLitSprite",
set the "Diffuse Map" to the texture you just created and the "Normal Map" to the normal map you just created

(IF ALL YOU WANT IS A SPRITE SHEET WITH LIGHTING THEN YOU ARE FINISHED, JUST MAKE SURE TO ASSIGN THE NEW MATERIAL WHEN YOU SWITCH ANIMATIONS)

STEP NINE: To convert this sprite sheet into an animation check out this amazing video: https://youtu.be/RGYdzTOvKXQ
- If you do use this method make sure to change the material in the "Sprite Renderer" to the current animation material at the start of the animation

PS: LIGHTING ONLY WORKS WITH DIRECTIONAL LIGHT
PS: WHEN FLIPPING THE CHARACTER, ROTATE IT 180 DEGREES INSTEAD OF CHANGING THE SIZE TO -1 OTHERWISE THE LIGHTING WON'T WORK
